<center><h2> Hill Climbing Problem - Numbers (0 to 15 in Binary)</h2></center>
<br>
Try to find the best solution to maximize the number of bits setted as 1 in the numbers between 0 and 15 in binary.
<br>
Example: Let's supose whe random a number between 0 and 15, and this random number was 5. 5 in binary is 0101. Our goal is to transform this 0101 into 1111 (15) to maximize our result.

The deal here is to get the local best, not the global best. Sometimes the local is the global best, and sometimes its not. 
You can set the algorith to accept blank spaces or repeat colors to make the code harder to break. 
As you put more iterations best is the chance to get the global best.
