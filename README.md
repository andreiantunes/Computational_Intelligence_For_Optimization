##Hill Climbing Problem = Try to find the best solution to maximize the number of bits setted as 1 in the numbers between 0 and 15 in binary.

Example: Let's supose whe random a number between 0 and 15, and this random number was 5. 5 in binary is 0101. Our goal is to transform this 0101 into 1111 (15) to maximize our result.
